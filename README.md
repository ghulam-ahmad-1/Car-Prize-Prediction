<title>Car Price Prediction with Linear Regression</title>
<h1>Car Price Prediction with Linear Regression</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This code is a simple example of using Linear Regression to predict car prices based on various features. It takes advantage of Python's powerful libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn. In this README, we will explain the code step by step and provide a clear understanding of what it does.</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>
    <p>Before running the code, ensure that you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip:</p>
    <pre><code>pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib</code></pre>

<h2>Data</h2>
    <p>The code reads car data from a CSV file named "car_data.csv" using the pandas library. It then drops the "Owner" column, as it is not used for prediction. The target variable (dependent variable) is the "Selling_Price," and the features (independent variables) are all other columns in the dataset.</p>

<h2>Data Preprocessing</h2>
    <p>The code performs some data preprocessing steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Encoding Categorical Variables:</strong></p>
            <p>The code uses LabelEncoder from scikit-learn to convert categorical variables like "Car_Name," "Transmission," "Selling_type," and "Fuel_Type" into numerical values. This is necessary as machine learning models require numerical input.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Splitting Data:</strong></p>
            <p>The dataset is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split from scikit-learn. It allocates 70% of the data for training and 30% for testing, ensuring that the data is randomly shuffled for better model generalization.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

<h2>Model Building</h2>
    <p>The code uses a simple linear regression model to predict car prices. The steps for building the model are as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Import the LinearRegression class from scikit-learn.</li>
        <li>Create a LinearRegression model (regressor).</li>
        <li>Fit the model to the training data using the fit() method.</li>
    </ol>

<h2>Making Predictions</h2>
    <p>The code uses the trained model to make predictions on the test data. It uses the predict() method on the model and stores the predictions in the "Y_predict" variable.</p>

<h2>Model Evaluation</h2>
    <p>The code calculates the accuracy of the model using the score() method. This method calculates the coefficient of determination (R-squared) for the model's predictions. The R-squared value measures how well the model fits the data, with higher values indicating a better fit.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This code showcases a basic example of using linear regression to predict car prices. It provides a foundation for more complex machine learning projects and can be extended to include additional features or explore different regression techniques.</p>
